# TheDryWay
Application files for an app called The Dry Way.

This application was created as part of my university studies. It was designed and developed soley by myself. It was on the Apple App Store for around 9 months from September 2018 to June 2019. 

The application shows the amount of rainfall along a selected journey. It is meant to be used to avoid the rain. The application uses Google Maps API to generate journeys on the map and The Dark Sky API to generate the weather forecasts at specific coordinates on the journey.
